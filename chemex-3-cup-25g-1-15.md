   - At 1:45, pour to reach a total of 375 grams of water (final pour).

4. **Drawdown**:
   - Allow the water to drip through the coffee grounds.
   - The total brew time should be between 4 to 5 minutes.

5. **Serve**:
   - Once the dripping has slowed to a stop, remove the filter, swirl the coffee in the Chemex to mix, and serve.

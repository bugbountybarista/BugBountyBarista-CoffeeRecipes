| Altitude Range   | General Characteristics                           | Recommended Brewing Methods  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Low Altitude (0 to 800 meters) | - Coffee grown at lower altitudes usually matures quickly due to warmer temperatures, leading to beans with simpler flavors and lower acidity. - These coffees are often described as having a fuller body with earthy, nutty, or chocolatey flavors. | French Press, Espresso, Cold Brew |
| Medium Altitude (800 to 1,200 meters) | - Coffees from medium altitudes have a more balanced profile, offering a mix of body and acidity. - They can exhibit a wider range of flavors compared to low altitude coffees, with some fruity or floral notes appearing alongside nutty or chocolatey characteristics. | Pour Over, Aeropress, Espresso |
| High Altitude (1,200 to 1,800 meters) |  - High altitude coffees are often prized for their bright acidity and complex flavor profiles, as the cooler temperatures allow for slower maturation of the coffee cherries. - These coffees may have fruity, floral, or spicy flavors and are often described as having a tea-like quality. | Pour Over, Aeropress, Espresso, Siphon |
| Very High Altitude (above 1,800 meters) | - At very high altitudes, coffee cherries mature very slowly, often developing extremely bright acidity and highly complex, nuanced flavors. - These coffees are among the most sought-after and can have exceptionally vibrant, exotic flavor profiles with a lighter body and pronounced acidity. | Pour Over, Aeropress, Siphon |

Basic French Press Recipe (17 oz Bodum)
Equipment:

    Bodum 17 oz French Press
    Burr grinder
    Kettle
    Scale
    Timer

Ingredients:

    Coarse ground coffee (approximately 30 grams)
    Hot water (about 500 ml, just off the boil, around 200°F or 93°C)

Steps:

    Preheat: Preheat your French Press by rinsing it with hot water. This helps maintain the brewing temperature.

    Grind Coffee: Grind 30 grams of coffee to a coarse consistency, similar to breadcrumbs. The coarse grind is crucial to avoid over-extraction and sediment in your cup.

    Add Coffee: Discard the hot water used for preheating and add the ground coffee to the French Press.

    Add Water: Start your timer and pour in 500 ml of hot water, ensuring all the grounds are saturated. Pour gently and evenly to encourage a balanced extraction.

    Stir: At about the 30-second mark, gently stir the mixture to break up the crust of grounds on top. This helps ensure even extraction.

    Steep: Allow the coffee to steep for 4 minutes. This is a general guideline, but you can adjust the steeping time to taste. Longer steep times result in stronger brews.

    Press: After 4 minutes, slowly press the plunger down. Pressing too fast can cause agitation, leading to a bitter brew.

    Serve Immediately: Pour the coffee into cups or a carafe immediately after pressing to prevent over-extraction. Coffee left in the French Press with the grounds will continue to extract and can become bitter.

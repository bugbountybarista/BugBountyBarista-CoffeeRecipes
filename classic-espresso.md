## Basic Espresso Recipe:
- **Coffee**: 18 grams (for a standard double shot)
- **Grind Size**: Fine (similar to table salt, but you'll need to dial in the grind size based on your specific equipment and coffee beans)
- **Water Temperature**: 200°F to 205°F
- **Extraction Time**: 25 to 30 seconds
- **Yield**: Approximately 36 grams (a 1:2 coffee-to-water ratio, which is typical for a standard double espresso)

### Procedure:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Warm up your espresso machine according to the manufacturer's instructions.
   - Ensure your portafilter and basket are clean and dry.
   
2. **Grinding**:
   - Grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency, similar to table salt.
   - It's recommended to grind fresh right before brewing to maintain the coffee's flavor.

3. **Dosing and Tamping**:
   - Dose 18 grams of coffee into your portafilter.
   - Distribute the coffee grounds evenly in the portafilter and tamp firmly to ensure an even surface. This will help with even extraction.

4. **Pulling the Shot**:
   - Insert the portafilter into the machine and start the extraction process.
   - Aim for a shot that takes 25 to 30 seconds to extract and yields about 36 grams of espresso.

5. **Taste and Adjust**:
   - Taste the shot. If it's bitter or harsh, it might be over-extracted, and you may need to coarsen the grind or shorten the extraction time.
   - If it's sour or underwhelming, it might be under-extracted, and you may need to fine-tune the grind or lengthen the extraction time.

6. **Record Your Results**:
   - Note down the grind setting, dose, extraction time, and yield, along with how the espresso tasted. This will help you dial in your espresso recipe over time.
